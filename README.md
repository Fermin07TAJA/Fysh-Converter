# Fysh-Converter

INSTALLATION:
Download and run the exe file. To access it manually, type "FyshConverter" into the app search bar.

To create a shortcut for it, navigate to the folder where you saved it, and create a shortcut to the 'FyshConverter.exe' or 'FastFysh.exe' file (Google "show file extensions" if you do not see them). 

Drag this shortcut to the desktop, taskbar, or wherever it is convenient.

Finally, run it once to create the folders it needs in your 'Downloads' directory.

DOWNLOADING FFMPEG With FyshConverter

DOWNLOADING AND CONVERTING With FastFysh (Added 2024-03-17 - Happy St Patricks Day):
Add single song URL (not a playlist) and an optional output file path. No file path will download to the default FyshConverter path. This combines the download and converting process for individual songs.
